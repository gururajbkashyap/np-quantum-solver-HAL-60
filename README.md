# NP-Hard Quantum Solver

## Overview
The NP-Hard Quantum Solver is a project designed to leverage quantum computing techniques to solve NP-hard optimization problems efficiently. By encoding the problem into quantum representations and utilizing quantum algorithms such as Grover’s search and QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm), we achieve significant computational speedup compared to classical approaches.

## Motivation
Classical algorithms struggle with solving NP-hard problems due to their exponential time complexity. Traditional methods rely on brute force or heuristic approaches, which become infeasible as problem size increases. Quantum computing, through principles like superposition and entanglement, provides a promising alternative by exploring multiple solutions simultaneously, reducing computational overhead.

## Objectives
- Implement quantum algorithms to solve NP-hard problems efficiently.
- Compare quantum approaches with classical counterparts.
- Utilize quantum simulators such as IBM Qiskit and Oracle Quantum Search.
- Optimize search operations using Grover’s Algorithm for better performance.

## Methodology
1. **Problem Representation**: We first convert the given NP-hard problem into a quantum-compatible representation using qubits and appropriate mathematical formulations.
2. **Quantum Encoding**: Using techniques such as QAOA and Hamiltonian encoding, we translate the problem into a quantum circuit.
3. **Simulation & Execution**: The quantum circuits are executed using IBM Qiskit and Oracle Quantum Search simulators to validate their efficiency.
4. **Algorithm Application**: Grover’s search algorithm is applied to enhance search operations, reducing query complexity from O(N) to O(√N).
5. **Hybrid Optimization**: Classical optimizers fine-tune quantum parameters for improved solution accuracy.
6. **Result Analysis**: A comparative study between classical and quantum approaches is conducted to evaluate speed and accuracy improvements.
